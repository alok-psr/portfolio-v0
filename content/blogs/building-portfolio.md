# Introduction

In a world of mouse-driven interfaces, I wanted to build something different. A portfolio that appeals to developers—the people who live in the terminal.

## The Idea

The concept was simple: a website that looks like a modern web app but behaves like a CLI when you want it to.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and static generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid styling and the "frame" aesthetic.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations.

## Conclusion

This project was a fun experiment in combining aesthetics with utility.
